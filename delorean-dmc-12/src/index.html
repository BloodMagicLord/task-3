      favorites</h2>

      <p class="article-main-image-description">Team Indonesia on IESF</p>
    </div>

    <p class="article-text"> Team Indonesia came out on top of the International Esports
      Federation’s 14th World
      Esports Championship 2022 (IESF 2022) Mobile Legends: Bang Bang event after a triumphant 3-0
      sweep over tournament favorite SIBOL in the grand final on Sunday, December 11.</p>

    <p class="article-text"> The ID squad, composed of members from EVOS Legends and its MDL team
      EVOS Icon, did
      not lose a single game to SIBOL in the tournament, which comprise the starting five of
      three-time MPL PH champion Blacklist International.
      After defeating SIBOL in the upper bracket quarterfinal in a decisive 2-0 victory,
      Indonesia dispatched Argentina and Cambodia to secure the first grand final slot. In the
      lower bracket, SIBOL took down Argentina, Malaysia, and Cambodia, eventually securing a
      rematch.</p>

    <p class="article-text">
      Per IESF regulation, Team ID automatically secured one game in the grand final because they
      qualified from the upper bracket.
      Up by one, Indonesia drafted Jabran “Branz” Wiloko’s signature Beatrix and Rizqi “Saykots”
      Damank’s Yu Zhong. On the other hand, SIBOL picked Benedetta for Edward “PHI.Dapadap” Dapadap
      and Lesley for Kiel “PHI.Soriano” Soriano.

      It was a back-and-forth affair in the early game, with the gold laners of both teams dictating
      the tempo. However, Indonesia pulled away in the mid to late game thanks to multiple
      successful Iron Hooks from Rachmad “DreamS” Wahyudi’s Franco. </p>
    <p class="article-text">
      After killing the Enhanced Lord at the 16-minute mark, Indonesia initiated a team fight in the
      midlane to try and end the game. SIBOL tried to defend, but DreamS caught Salic “Hadji” Imam’s
      Pharsa behind the tower.

    <h2 class="article-title">Taking Lichess to the Next Level</h2>

    <p class="article-text">
      Last month, we published a blog about Lichess’s charity nonprofit status. In this post, we
      want to dive deeper into Lichess’s history, how we’re currently set up, and our plans for
      the future.

      Between 2010 and 2016, virtually all of Lichess’s costs were covered by Lichess’s founder
      and main developer Thibault Duplessis. Lichess at the time was an association de fait, a
      basic association type that doesn’t require a formal legal structure.

      However, even as early as 2015 it was obvious that this wasn't sustainable, as by that point
      the site’s monthly operating costs had grown to thousands of dollars per month.</p>

    <p class="article-text">
      Therefore, in 2016, Lichess was formally registered under French law as an association loi
      1901. This type of association applies to groups with clearly defined purposes that benefit
      the public, similar to charities. However, it’s quite easy to form one - the total number in
      France is over 1.5 million!

      Like all French associations, Lichess has a formal charter that sets out how it works for
      the public benefit. Our official purpose is “to promote and encourage the teaching and
      practice of the game of chess and its variants” (“promouvoir et favoriser l'enseignement et
      la pratique du jeu d'échecs et de ses variantes”).

      Lichess’s association status gives us legal recognition, access to banking services, and the
      ability to employ staff and rent or own property. We also have to pay our fair share of
      employer taxes and social security contributions for our three salaried employees with
      permanent contracts, one of whom is Thibault. We also pay some additional team members for
      their work in key areas such as development, content/community, general operations and site
      moderation, but they are technically contractors, not employees; in total our budget covers
      the equivalent of around seven full-time positions.</p>

    <p class="article-text">
      We’ve also been looking into options to set up a charitable presence in the United States,
      by either partnering with an existing charity or helping to set up a new independent
      501(c)(3) organisation to support free open source software/technology in chess. This would
      allow US donors to make tax-deductible donations, and it might also help boost the global
      profile of our mission and activities. It will take a lot of work though, and we’ve only
      started the journey. Hopefully we’ll be able to say more about this soon!

      We know that it won’t be easy to achieve these ambitions. We know that we’ll need to talk to
      awesome accountants and lovely lawyers, especially for the 501(c)(3) initiative. We know
      we’ll probably need to complete forms and produce reports, including annual end of year
      reports (which is something we want to do anyway). We know that all of this will increase
      our admin costs.

      But we also see this as an exciting opportunity to make Lichess stronger. After all, we want
      to remove barriers that prevent people from playing chess, studying chess, learning chess
      and discovering free open source software (FOSS). We believe that what we’ve built – the
      fruits of centuries of collective collaboration – should be free for anyone to access. And
      by ‘free’, we mean free both as in freedom (libre) and also as in price (gratis). No
      trackers. No ads. We want to equitably support the chess community (players, content
      creators, professionals, etc.) as well as the wider FOSS ecosystem. We understand that this
      stuff might not be as exciting as talking about a new feature, but we hope that our
      community and our supporters can appreciate its importance.</p>

    <h2 class="article-title">‘Hey GitHub!’ Tries a Voice Interface for Copilot</h2>

    <p class="article-text"> It’s been two weeks since GitHub unveiled “Hey, GitHub!” — a new voice
      interface for GitHub Copilot — at the annual GitHub Universe conference in San Francisco.
      But it’s generating some excitement…</p>

    <blockquote class="article-blockquote">
      <p class="article-blockquote-text">We’ve been blown away by the overwhelming support and
        enthusiasm. Since unveiling it at Universe nearly 7,000 people have joined the waitlist for
        the technical preview.</p>

    </blockquote>

    <p class="article-text">
      Pandita has been part of the group behind the project, GitHub Next, since 2021, after
      previously working at Phase Change Software on an AI assistant for COBOL programmers. Pandita
      now believes the thousands of signups for the technical preview of Hey, GitHub “goes to show
      how hungry the community is for tools that can boost productivity for all developers and make
      coding more accessible to people that have difficulty using a keyboard.”

    <p class="article-text">
      “Type less, code more,” explained GitHub’s new webpage for the project, touting an
      experimental new tool promising to let developers “write code without the keyboard.”

      But in our interview, Pandita emphasized that it’s not just a novelty and that one of the
      project’s top priorities is serving communities with a need for accessible interfaces. “We’re
      letting folks into the technical preview on a rolling basis, and are working hard to ensure we
      have enough developers that have difficulty using a keyboard represented.”
