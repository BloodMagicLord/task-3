Indonesia has done it!

Team Indonesia came out on top of the International Esports Federationâ€™s 14th World Esports Championship 2022 (IESF 2022) Mobile Legends: Bang Bang event after a triumphant 3-0 sweep over tournament favorite SIBOL in the grand final on Sunday, December 11.

The ID squad, composed of members from EVOS Legends and its MDL team EVOS Icon, did not lose a single game to SIBOL in the tournament, which comprise the starting five of three-time MPL PH champion Blacklist International.

After defeating SIBOL in the upper bracket quarterfinal in a decisive 2-0 victory, Indonesia dispatched Argentina and Cambodia to secure the first grand final slot. In the lower bracket, SIBOL took down Argentina, Malaysia, and Cambodia, eventually securing a rematch.
