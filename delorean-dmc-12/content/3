‘Hey GitHub!’ Tries a Voice Interface for Copilot

It’s been two weeks since GitHub unveiled “Hey, GitHub!” — a new voice interface for GitHub Copilot — at the annual GitHub Universe conference in San Francisco.

But it’s generating some excitement…

“We’ve been blown away by the overwhelming support and enthusiasm,” GitHub staff researcher Rahul Pandita said in an email interview last week. “Since unveiling it at Universe nearly 7,000 people have joined the waitlist for the technical preview.”

Pandita has been part of the group behind the project, GitHub Next, since 2021, after previously working at Phase Change Software on an AI assistant for COBOL programmers. Pandita now believes the thousands of signups for the technical preview of Hey, GitHub “goes to show how hungry the community is for tools that can boost productivity for all developers and make coding more accessible to people that have difficulty using a keyboard.”

“Type less, code more,” explained GitHub’s new webpage for the project, touting an experimental new tool promising to let developers “write code without the keyboard.”

But in our interview, Pandita emphasized that it’s not just a novelty and that one of the project’s top priorities is serving communities with a need for accessible interfaces. “We’re letting folks into the technical preview on a rolling basis, and are working hard to ensure we have enough developers that have difficulty using a keyboard represented.”

Changing Our Craft
“‘Hey, GitHub!’ is still an experiment, and GitHub does not have any plans for a public launch yet.

It’s just one of several projects from GitHub Next, a group described on its webpage as “a team of researchers and engineers at GitHub, exploring things beyond the adjacent possible. Some other projects from GitHub Next include GitHub Blocks for creating interactive code repositories, folders, and files, with everything from search windows and workflow interfaces to embeddable diagrams and data visualizations. And there’s also GitHub Copilot CLI, which uses Copilot’s functionality to suggest input for your command line.

But it’s coding by voice that captured the imagination of Pandita and his team. “If GitHub Copilot is our pair programmer, why can’t we talk to it?” GitHub’s CEO asks in his blog post, adding “That’s exactly what the GitHub Next team is working towards.”

The project’s official webpage shows off its ability to instantly translate plain-English commands into code. It responds to everything from “Hey, GitHub! Insert new line” and “import graph plotting library” to more complex commands like “clean records from titanic data where age is null” and “fill null values of column Fare with average column values.”
